# T-Bird
My experiments and libraries with T-Bird AVR development board.<br>
I'm using VSCode as an IDE with c/cpp extension under Linux. I created VSCode task to execute MakeFile.<br>

## Organisation of the source code<br>
-**:file_folder:drivers**:This folder contain all code wich is related to drive something (like LCD,7segment display, keyboad matrix)<br>
-**:file_folder:HAL**: This folder contain all code wich is related to the integrated peripherials (like SPI,I2C,TIMER)<br>
-**:file_folder:utils**: Everyting else<br>
